super alpha!

### what?
* Sonic Mirror is an open-ended audio software (and hardware) system designed for autonomous embedded audio recording, generative sound, music, and acoustic experimentation.

* Programmed with the SuperCollider language.  Project details and documentation online:

http://scott-tooby.com/sonic-mirror-room-installation.html

### what do I need?
* At least a modern computer with a built-in soundcard, microphone, and speakers. (In practice, any computer with an audio interface and connected microphone and speaker system will do.)

* SuperCollider: http://supercollider.github.io/

### how do I turn this thing on?
* Open the "SonicMirror.scd" file with SuperCollider. Evaluate the lines and bracketed blocks of code in order from #1 - 3.

### how do I run this thing?
* Press the 'REC' button to begin recording audio input to the buffer

* Press the 'PLAY' button to begin playing audio back from the buffer

* Press the "REV" button to play audio in reverse

* Enabling the "!", "!!", or "!!!" buttons will trigger various generative processing and playback modes.

* Pro tip: arranging your microphone and speaker(s) so they feed back on themselves can create some fantastic sounds when the Sonic Mirror's mode buttons are enabled, or during manual control of various playback parameters.  Watch out for feedback!

It has been tested only on Mac and Linux systems.  Works great on Raspberry Pi 3 for hours and days on end!
