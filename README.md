super alpha!  (work in progress!)

### what?
* Sonic Mirror is an open-ended audio software (and hardware) instrument designed for autonomous embedded audio recording, generative sound, and musical performance.

* Programmed with the SuperCollider language.  Project details and documentation online:  http://scott-tooby.com/sonic-mirror.html

### how do I turn this thing on?
* Evaluate the lines and bracketed blocks of code in order from #1 - 3.

### how do I run this thing?
* Press the 'REC' button to begin recording audio input to the buffer

* Press the 'PLAY' button to begin playing audio back from the buffer

* Press the "REV" button to play audio in reverse

* Enabling the "!", "!!", or "!!!" buttons will trigger various autonomous playback behaviors.  Parameters like: rate, pitch, pitch shift mix, output volume, reverse, and playhead position will be randomly modulated over time.

* Pro tip: arranging your microphone and speaker(s) so they feed back on themselves can create some fantastic sounds when the Sonic Mirror's autonomous behavior buttons are enabled, or during manual control of various playback parameters.  Watch out for runaway feedback!

This is a work in progress...

It has been tested only on Mac and Linux systems.  Can run 4+ hours w/out any hiccups on a Raspberry Pi 2!
